            <p class="texto">For the final project we worked as a team of 4 students
                developing an application given its requirements
                beforehand. The application allowed users to purchase
                and print tickets for various events, those tickets
                included a QR code which would be later scanned on a
                terminal at the entrance of the event. The terminal
                consisted of a Raspberry Pi with a camera which
                scanned the code and marked it as used in the
                database, and the Windows application was developed
                using Visual Basic .Net, we also used Informix as a SQL
                database in order to store all the required data for the
                system.
